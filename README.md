# Metafacture Playground

This is an approach to provide a web application to play around with Metafactures languages Fix and Flux inspired by the [JSON-LD Playground](https://json-ld.org/playground/).
This project is inititially created using the [leiningen re-frame template](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-template).

$ cd metafacture-playground
```
